The main purpose of this repo is to review and practice exercises in this book to have a better understanding of commomly used algorithms.


##Structure 
containersImpl directory contains implementation practices of data structures mentioned in Algorithms 4th edition


### Tips during implementation
To create a template class, all implementation details should be in header file(or at least visible for header file). More details in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/495021/why-can-templates-only-be-implemented-in-the-header-file#_=_

2 ways to do so
   - write template class details in header file
   - write implementation details in .tpp file and include it in hpp
